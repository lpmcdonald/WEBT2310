            <img src="images/01.jpg" alt="Featured Chevelle SS">

            <p>This 1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS Tribute has everything a true American muscle car should have.</p>

            <p>For starters, it is convertible, which is a great advantage. But in addition, this beauty is also equipped with a competent 402 cubic inch engine and fitted with a 4-speed manual transmission.</p>
        
            <p>On the outside, this 1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS Tribute Convertible shows an excellent paint job with the classic red with black stripes. Its black alloy wheels, white letter tires, and dual exhaust tailpipes complete the overall look you can expect for this model.</p>

            <p>Itâ€™s not until you get inside the cabin that you start noticing the modifications. A big Autometer tachometer and a shiny B&M shifter, typical of the 70s and 80s, invites you to hit the road. An aftermarket car audio with two speakers completes the modifications to the original equipment. The rest of the interior, the front and rear seats, the steering wheel and dashboard are all original.</p>
            
            <p>Opening the hood only confirms that the former owner loved the power of Chevy engines. The aftermarket exhaust headers, performance spark plug wires and distributor, chrome air filter, and the fuel pressure regulator is a clear invitation for fun.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, there is a classic vehicle for every soul. Some prefer elegance and sobriety while others opt for pure power. The Chevelle SS is not elegant nor sober but its potential as muscle car is second to none.This 1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS Tribute Convertible screams to be used during sunny weekends. </p>
