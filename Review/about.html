            Kelsey, Kendall and Kyle Pearson are triplets from Bainbridge, Georgia. They began singing together in church and realized their harmonies were something special. In addition to the classic hymns, the trio also have secular influences in their music such as rock bands Journey, Queen and Foreigner, along with quintessential country legends like Loretta Lynn and Johnny Cash. The three keep their lyrics honest and their music full of roots and authenticity. They are currently recording a studio album, produced by Alan Shelton and are continuing to write for future projects. Performing all over the country in venues like arenas, theaters, and outdoor music festivals, the three have a love and passion for traveling together and meeting their fans. Kelsey, Kendall and Kyle take great pride in writing their own music and connecting with fans through their lyrics. Together, the three encompass what it means to be proud southerners with a love for what they do. Triplicity is bringing a new “old school country with a rhinestone flair” to Nashville.
